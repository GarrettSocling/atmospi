v0.2.4
------

This release fixes a few bugs:

* https://github.com/mstenta/atmospi/issues/3
* https://github.com/mstenta/atmospi/issues/26
* https://github.com/mstenta/atmospi/issues/27
* https://github.com/mstenta/atmospi/issues/28

It also changes humidity graphs to a dotted line, so that they can be more easily distinguised from temperature (solid line).

v0.2.3
------

This release adds a setting to select the default temperature units of measure (Celsius or Fahrenheit). It defaults to Fahrenheit, because I wrote it. :-)

If you have a settings.py file overriding default_settings.py, you will need to add the new 't_unit' variable (see default_settings.py as an example).

Restart Apache to complete the changes.

v0.2.2
------

This release adds a setting for specifying how many decimal places to store (measurement precision), and defaults to 2.

If you have a settings.py file overriding default_settings.py, you will need to add the new 'precision' variable (see default_settings.py as an example).

v0.2.1
------

This release adds a setting for specifying how much data to load, and defaults to loading only data from the past week.

If you have a settings.py file overriding default_settings.py, you will need to add the new 'range_seconds' variable (see default_settings.py as an example).

v0.2.0
------
Adds device identification (see https://github.com/mstenta/atmospi/issues/10), which greatly improves data loading performance, and adds the ability to define human-friendly labels for each device.

This release requires manual updates of both the datbase and settings.py.

It is highly recommended that you back up your database file before proceeding.

    cp ~/atmospi/log.db ~/atmospi/log.db.v0.1.0

First, create a new Devices table in the SQLite database:

    CREATE TABLE Devices(DeviceID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, Type TEXT, SerialID TEXT, Label TEXT);

Second, add records for each of your devices. Below is an example of each type.

DS18B20:

    INSERT INTO Devices (DeviceID, Type, SerialID, Label) VALUES (NULL, 'ds18b20', '28-000000000001', 'Basement Temperature');

DHT22:

    INSERT INTO Devices (DeviceID, Type, SerialID, Label) VALUES (NULL, 'dht22', '22', 'DHT22 Sensor on Pin 22');

AM2302:

    INSERT INTO Devices (DeviceID, Type, SerialID, Label) VALUES (NULL, 'am2302', '16', 'AM2302 Sensor on Pin 16');

Third, add a new DeviceID column to the Temperature, Humidity, and Flag tables:

    ALTER TABLE Temperature ADD COLUMN DeviceID INT;
    ALTER TABLE Humidity ADD COLUMN DeviceID INT;
    ALTER TABLE Flag ADD COLUMN DeviceID INT;

Fourth, reference the new device IDs in the Temperature, Humidity, and Flag tables. For example, if you have a DHT22 sensor that was previously labeled "Upstairs DHT22" in settings.py, and it now has a DeviceID of 1 in the Devices table, run the following:

    UPDATE Temperature SET DeviceID = 1 WHERE Device = "Upstairs DHT22";
    UPDATE Humidity SET DeviceID = 1 WHERE Device = "Upstairs DHT22";
    UPDATE Flag SET DeviceID = 1 WHERE Device = "Upstairs DHT22";

Fifth, remove the Device column from the Temperature, Humidity, and Flag databases.

    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE Temperature_backup(DeviceID INT, Timestamp INT, C REAL, F REAL);
    INSERT INTO Temperature_backup SELECT DeviceID, Timestamp, C, F FROM Temperature;
    DROP TABLE Temperature;
    CREATE TABLE Temperature(DeviceID INT, Timestamp INT, C REAL, F REAL);
    INSERT INTO Temperature SELECT DeviceID, Timestamp, C, F FROM Temperature_backup;
    DROP TABLE Temperature_backup;
    COMMIT;

    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE Humidity_backup(DeviceID INT, Timestamp INT, H REAL);
    INSERT INTO Humidity_backup SELECT DeviceID, Timestamp, H FROM Humidity;
    DROP TABLE Humidity;
    CREATE TABLE Humidity(DeviceID INT, Timestamp INT, H REAL);
    INSERT INTO Humidity SELECT DeviceID, Timestamp, H FROM Humidity_backup;
    DROP TABLE Humidity_backup;
    COMMIT;

    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE Flag_backup(DeviceID INT, Timestamp INT, Value REAL);
    INSERT INTO Flag_backup SELECT DeviceID, Timestamp, Value FROM Flag;
    DROP TABLE Flag;
    CREATE TABLE Flag(DeviceID INT, Timestamp INT, Value REAL);
    INSERT INTO Flag SELECT DeviceID, Timestamp, Value FROM Flag_backup;
    DROP TABLE Flag_backup;
    COMMIT;

Finally, build new (and much improved) indices:

    CREATE INDEX temperature_dt ON Temperature(DeviceID, Timestamp);
    CREATE INDEX humidity_dt ON Humidity(DeviceID, Timestamp);
    CREATE INDEX flag_dt ON Flag(DeviceID, Timestamp);

Update (or just delete) settings.py: The dht_devices variable that was used in settings.py to define DHT11, DHT22, and AM2302 is no longer used. If you are only using DS18B20 sensors, you don't have to do anything. Otherwise, you can delete the settings.py file and just let it fall back on default_settings.py.

Update your code via Git:

    git checkout v0.2.0

Restart Apache:

    sudo apache2ctl restart

Done!

v0.1.0
------
This is an initial pre-release for folks running Atmospis. Following releases may start to introduce database and/or settings.py changes that require some manual updating. If so, these release notes will be used to document the necessary steps.
